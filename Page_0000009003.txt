                      ToolTipML=ENU=Compensate your customers for incorrect or damaged items that you sent to them and received payment for. Sales return orders enable you to receive items from multiple sales documents with one sales return, automatically create related sales credit memos or other return-related documents, such as a replacement sales order, and support warehouse documents for the item handling. Note: If an erroneous sale has not been paid yet, you can simply cancel the posted sales invoice to automatically revert the financial transaction.;

Each reminder level includes rules about when the reminder will be issued in relation to the invoice due date or the date of the previous reminder and whether interests are added. Reminders are integrated with finance charge memos, which are documents informing customers of interests or other money penalties for payment delays.;

                      ToolTipML=ENU=Post financial transactions directly to general ledger accounts and other accounts, such as bank, customer, vendor, and employee accounts. Posting with a general journal always creates entries on general ledger accounts. This is true even when, for example, you post a journal line to a customer account, because an entry is posted to a general ledger receivables account through a posting group.;

A direct debit collection holds information about the customer's bank account, the affected sales invoices, and the customer's agreement, the so-called direct-debit mandate. From the resulting direct-debit collection entry, you can then export an XML file that you send or upload to your bank for processing.;
