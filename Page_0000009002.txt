Purchase return orders enable you to ship back items from multiple purchase documents with one purchase return and support warehouse documents for the item handling. Purchase return orders can be created automatically from PDF or image files from your vendors by using the Incoming Documents feature. Note: If you have not yet paid for an erroneous purchase, you can simply cancel the posted purchase invoice to automatically revert the financial transaction.;

If you need more control of the purchase return process, such as warehouse documents for the physical handling, use purchase return orders, in which purchase credit memos are integrated. Purchase credit memos can be created automatically from PDF or image files from your vendors by using the Incoming Documents feature. Note: If you have not yet paid for an erroneous purchase, you can simply cancel the posted purchase invoice to automatically revert the financial transaction.;

A payment journal is a type of general journal that is used to post outgoing payment transactions to G/L, bank, customer, vendor, employee, and fixed assets accounts. The Suggest Vendor Payments functions automatically fills the journal with payments that are due. When payments are posted, you can export the payments to a bank file for upload to your bank if your system is set up for electronic banking. You can also issue computer checks from the payment journal.;
