Posting with a general journal always creates entries on general ledger accounts. This is true even when, for example, you post a journal line to a customer account, because an entry is posted to a general ledger receivables account through a posting group.;

A payment journal is a type of general journal that is used to post outgoing payment transactions to G/L, bank, customer, vendor, employee, and fixed assets accounts. The Suggest Vendor Payments functions automatically fills the journal with payments that are due. When payments are posted, you can export the payments to a bank file for upload to your bank if your system is set up for electronic banking. You can also issue computer checks from the payment journal.;

In the payment reconciliation journal, incoming or outgoing payments on your bank are automatically, or semi-automatically, applied to their related open customer or vendor ledger entries. Any open bank account ledger entries related to the applied customer or vendor ledger entries will be closed when you choose the Post Payments and Reconcile Bank Account action. This means that the bank account is automatically reconciled for payments that you post with the journal.;

A direct debit collection holds information about the customer's bank account, the affected sales invoices, and the customer's agreement, the so-called direct-debit mandate.

Blanket orders often cover only one item with predetermined delivery dates. The main reason for using a blanket order rather than a sales order is that quantities entered on a blanket order do not affect item availability and thus can be used as a worksheet for monitoring, forecasting, and planning purposes..;

Posting a sales invoice registers shipment and records an open receivable entry on the customer's account, which will be closed when payment is received. To manage the shipment process, use sales orders, in which sales invoicing is integrated.;

To include the correct information, you can create the sales credit memo from the related posted sales invoice or you can create a new sales credit memo with copied invoice information. If you need more control of the sales return process, such as warehouse documents for the physical handling, use sales return orders, in which sales credit memos are integrated. Note: If an erroneous sale has not been paid yet, you can simply cancel the posted sales invoice to automatically revert the financial transaction.;

                      ToolTipML=ENU=Create purchase orders to mirror sales documents that vendors send to you. This enables you to record the cost of purchases and to track accounts payable. Posting purchase orders dynamically updates inventory levels so that you can minimize inventory costs and provide better customer service. Purchase orders allow partial receipts, unlike with purchase invoices, and enable drop shipment directly from your vendor to your customer. Purchase orders can be created automatically from PDF or image files from your vendors by using the Incoming Documents feature.;

Blanket orders often cover only one item with predetermined delivery dates. The main reason for using a blanket order rather than a purchase order is that quantities entered on a blanket order do not affect item availability and thus can be used as a worksheet for monitoring, forecasting, and planning purposes.;

If you need more control of the purchase return process, such as warehouse documents for the physical handling, use purchase return orders, in which purchase credit memos are integrated. Purchase credit memos can be created automatically from PDF or image files from your vendors by using the Incoming Documents feature. Note: If you have not yet paid for an erroneous purchase, you can simply cancel the posted purchase invoice to automatically revert the financial transaction.;
