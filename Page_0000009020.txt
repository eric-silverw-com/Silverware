To include the correct information, you can create the sales credit memo from the related posted sales invoice or you can create a new sales credit memo with copied invoice information. If you need more control of the sales return process, such as warehouse documents for the physical handling, use sales return orders, in which sales credit memos are integrated. Note: If an erroneous sale has not been paid yet, you can simply cancel the posted sales invoice to automatically revert the financial transaction.;
