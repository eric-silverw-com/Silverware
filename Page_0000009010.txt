Blanket orders often cover only one item with predetermined delivery dates. The main reason for using a blanket order rather than a sales order is that quantities entered on a blanket order do not affect item availability and thus can be used as a worksheet for monitoring, forecasting, and planning purposes..;

Posting purchase orders dynamically updates inventory levels so that you can minimize inventory costs and provide better customer service. Purchase orders allow partial receipts, unlike with purchase invoices, and enable drop shipment directly from your vendor to your customer. Purchase orders can be created automatically from PDF or image files from your vendors by using the Incoming Documents feature.;
